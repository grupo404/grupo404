# “KIDS TODAY DON’T KNOW HOW TO LIVE, WITH THEIR EYES GLUED TO SCREENS”
#### A situational analysis of two opposing perspectives on today kids living in online videogames

I´m going to be straight with this. The current situation in my neighborhood has brought a question to my mind, which I believe to be crucial for our society. Since given its context, it may even impact the advertising industry, as well as the way in which we interact. So I want to ask you: How many times have you went outside of your house to play with your friends, or to complete your chores?  How many times have your friends, or your family has done it?  Most of us will have the same answer, a seemingly normal yet depressing and, extremely concerning answer. Because the fact is that many teenagers nowadays prefer to stay at home alone, only connected with their peers through online video games or other digital media. Where they share their experiences of a different reality.

There are two main positions on this issue, which are mainly a product of the conditions in which their supporters grew up in. On one hand we have people of older generations, more specifically the parents, who grew up without much influence of technology. Since there were not many things to do within the walls of their houses they looked to distract themselves, and enjoy their time along with other children from the block who experienced the same. They met outside, they played, they talked, and they lived. All of these while at least one of their parents kept an eye on them. The contrasting reality of the offspring of these now-grown-up children, consists on the majority of them having not even a single parent at the house. Most of the times because of an increased amount of work that needs to be done, or a financial situation that pushes them to stay at the office.

*Parents are now employing videogames to calm down little children*

A situation which coupled to a rise of the criminality in the cities, made parents worry about what could happen to their kids as they are not at home, locking them up at house. Despite this, electronic devices continue to lower their prices, which expanded the range of home appliances to include computers, television screens and even, to keep the kid happy, a video game system, without having to go out to the arcade, even for this experience, as their parents had.

Haven’t we all heard our parent’s stories about how things were better at their time? People clearly romanticize their childhood, and that will happen even with us. The thing here is that claims like that often don’t go as deep as to realize that the circumstances that caused those behaviors are abysmally different. However, we have to give it to our parents that clearly there are important health implications, like vision problems related to the blue light from the screens and maybe even not getting enough sun exposure, but as for the social relations it is clear that online gaming stands still, and maybe superior, because it expands the reach of the kids for them to chat with people all around the world, while also keeping them connected with their colleagues which they’ll meet tomorrow at school, while today they stay safe at home.
